# Sentiment Analysis

This project conducts sentiment analysis on a dataset of Amazon product customer reviews, using spaCy and TextBlob, to return whether the review is positve, negative or neutral.

## Installation

Install finalCapstone:

```cmd
  git remote add origin https://github.com/BeccaSR/finalCapstone
  cd finalCapstone
```
Ensure both the python and CSV files are installed to be able to successfully run the analysis.
## Usage

When running the sentiment analysis, the program will ask the user the index value of the review they wish to analyse. Please enter an integer value.

The program will print the unprocessed version of the review, along with the sentiment.

When you do not wish to proceed with more analyses, please enter 'Q'.

The program will then move to analyse all reviews, and provide an overall count of positive, negative and neutral reviews in the dataset.
